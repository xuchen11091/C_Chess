# Terminal Chess AI in C

This project is a fully functioning terminal-based chess game written in C, featuring a playable human vs AI mode, complete with move validation, board evaluation, and minimax AI with alpha-beta pruning. The engine supports advanced chess rules such as castling, en passant, and promotion, and includes a heuristic evaluation system tuned for competitive play.

## üéÆ Features

- Full chess game playable via terminal
- Human vs AI gameplay
- Minimax AI with alpha-beta pruning
- Rule-complete engine:
  - ‚úÖ Castling (both sides)
  - ‚úÖ En passant
  - ‚úÖ Pawn promotion
  - ‚úÖ Stalemate and checkmate detection
- Opening book for early AI moves
- Piece-square tables and tactical evaluation (e.g., hanging pieces)
- Dynamic attack map and king safety tracking
- Evaluation heuristics for:
  - Material balance
  - Passed, doubled, and isolated pawns
  - Bishop pair, connected rooks, castling bonuses
  - Hanging pieces and move ordering

## üß† AI & Evaluation Logic

The AI uses a depth-limited minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to search for the best moves. The evaluation function includes:

- `VALUE_PAWN`, `VALUE_KNIGHT`, `VALUE_BISHOP`, `VALUE_ROOK`, `VALUE_QUEEN`, `VALUE_KING`
- Positional scoring using piece-square tables
- Tactical considerations (e.g., hanging pieces, MVV-LVA)
- Bonus/Penalty weights for:
  - Passed pawns
  - Doubled/isolated pawns
  - Castled king
  - Connected rooks
  - Bishop pair

AI selects moves based on a scoring function that balances positional strategy and tactical gain.

## üß© Structure

Main components:
- `BOARD`: Struct containing game state, board, kings' positions, castling rights, en passant targets, etc.
- `MOVE`: Struct representing legal chess moves, including type (castling, en passant, promotion)
- `moveChecker()`: Validates individual piece moves
- `moveLeavesKingInCheck()`: Ensures king is not left in check after a move
- `evaluateBoard()`: Heuristic board evaluation used by minimax
- `minimax()`: Recursive AI search with alpha-beta pruning
- `generateMoves()`: Legal move generator with ordering for efficient pruning
- `startGame()`: Starts the player-vs-AI match loop

## üõ† How to Compile and Run

```bash
gcc -o chess main.c
./chess
```

Make sure all your functions and `main()` are in a single file (or adjust filenames accordingly).

---

## ‚å®Ô∏è How to Play

- Input your moves in the format `2e4e` (start square + end square)
  - e.g. `2e4e` moves the piece at e2 to e4
- Promotion will prompt a piece selection (Q/R/B/N)
- The game alternates between player (White) and AI (Black)

---

## üìÅ Files & Codebase Overview

- `main.c`: Main file containing board logic, AI logic, move evaluation, and game loop
- No external dependencies (pure standard C)
- Modular code separated into functions for:
  - Move generation
  - Evaluation
  - AI decision making
  - Game state validation

## üîç Potential Improvements

This is a strong foundation for a chess engine, but here are some possible upgrades:

- Add a GUI (e.g., SDL, ncurses)
- Implement PGN/FEN loading and saving
- Add support for threefold repetition and 50-move rule
- Integrate a more advanced evaluation model (e.g., neural network or centipawn analysis)
- Support UCI protocol for third-party GUI engines

## üôå Credits

Developed by Xu Chen (xuchen11091). Built using C and lots of debug patience. AI inspired by traditional chess engine design principles and heuristics used in classic engines.

## üí¨ Final Notes

This project serves as a deep dive into how chess engines work under the hood ‚Äî from board representation to AI search strategies. All rules are implemented manually without external libraries or prebuilt chess engines. It‚Äôs a great resource for learning AI, data structures, and game logic in C.
